## What is ddev-drupal-core-dev?
This is a [DDEV](https://github.com/ddev/ddev) add-on for doing Drupal Core development.


## Initial Setup

We're in #ddev-for-core-dev on [Drupal Slack](https://www.drupal.org/community/contributor-guide/reference-information/talk/tools/slack) (but please try and keep work and feature requests in Issues where it's visible to all 🙏)

```
git clone https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal.git drupal
cd drupal
# Because `ddev-drupal-core-dev` is using SQLite the database
# container is omitted by the `--omit-containers=db` flag
ddev config --omit-containers=db --disable-settings-management
ddev start
ddev corepack enable
ddev get justafish/ddev-drupal-core-dev
ddev restart
ddev composer install
````

## Install Drupal

To get an overview of the list of available tasks:

```
ddev drupal list
````

Next install a demo site, which is not intended for production:

````
ddev drupal install
````
> :warning: To avoid unstaged conflicts in git, **do not** `ddev composer require drush/drush`.  A subset of that kind of functionality is available with `ddev drupal list`.

To drop your database tables, for example if you're working in the context of the Drupal installer, manually delete the SQLite database file located in `sites/default/files/.sqlite`.


## PHPUnit

```
ddev phpunit core/modules/workspaces
```


## Nightwatch

You can watch Nightwatch running in real time at https://drupal.ddev.site:7900
for Chrome and https://drupal.ddev.site:7901 for Firefox. The password is
"secret". (Core tests using Firefox are not yet mature.)

Only core tests
```
ddev nightwatch --tag core
```

Skip running core tests
```
ddev nightwatch --skiptags core
```

Run a single test
```
ddev nightwatch tests/Drupal/Nightwatch/Tests/exampleTest.js
```

a11y tests for both the admin and default themes
```
ddev nightwatch --tag a11y
```

a11y tests for the admin theme only
```
ddev nightwatch --tag a11y:admin
```

a11y tests for the default theme only
```
ddev nightwatch --tag a11y:default
```

a11y test for a custom theme used as the default theme
```
ddev nightwatch --tag a11y:default --defaultTheme bartik
```

a11y test for a custom admin theme
```
ddev nightwatch --tag a11y:admin --adminTheme seven
```
